## Building
This is a very simple repository, it is very easy to build and configure. They are all ANT projects build with NetBeans8.2 and require a  **JDK version of 8** due to CORBA as well as GlashFish 4.1.1 for deploying the web service.

There is no installation of any kind other than the tool.
